# React GTK Experiment

This is an experimental project for rendering native GTK components.

It works by running React inside `gjs`, the native GTK JavaScript engine.

This is highly experimental and should not be used for production :)

## Running

To run the project:

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
